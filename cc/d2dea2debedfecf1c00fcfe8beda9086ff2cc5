v1-->v2:
- Handled different endianness between the host and the guest hypervisor
- Decoupled the stage-2 PTW from injecting exceptions. This will come in handy

- Added esr and upper_attr fields in kvm_s2_trans struct
- Reworked pa_max() to have KVM_PHYS_SHIFT
- Updated comment about the continuous bits
