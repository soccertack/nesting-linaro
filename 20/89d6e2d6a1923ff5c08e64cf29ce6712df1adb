v1-->v2:
- This is a merged commit of [RFC 39/55]  and [RFC 40/55].
- Updated the commit message and comments.
- Defer creating a new nested mmu structure until we enter the VM with stage 2
  paging enabled, which was previously done on vttbr_el2 write operation.
- Use the existing kvm->mmu_lock when iterating nested mmus instead of creating one.
